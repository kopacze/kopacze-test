Our main goal is\u00A0to\u00A0make space available for\u00A0workshops, camps, rest, relaxation, etc. for\u00A0people and\u00A0groups facing discrimination, as\u00A0well as\u00A0those who work against exclusion and\u00A0discrimination, advocating for\u00A0social and\u00A0environmental justice.\nIn\u00A0particular, we\u00A0are\u00A0committed to\u00A0making our\u00A0space welcoming and\u00A0safer for\u00A0transgender people, sex workers, activists experiencing political repressions and\u00A0all\u00A0those who\u00A0are\u00A0tired and\u00A0burned out\u00A0by\u00A0activism for\u00A0freedom and\u00A0justice.",

We are surrounded by\u00A0forests, medows and\u00A0fields, with a\u00A0little pond just behind our house. the\u00A0farm itself consist of\u00A0couple of\u00A0buildings - an\u00A0old barn which is\u00A0going to\u00A0become our main workshop space in\u00A0the\u00A0future, three workshop spaces and\u00A0house with an\u00A0attic.\nAt the\u00A0moment we have the\u00A0capacity to\u00A0host groups of\u00A06-8 people and\u00A0bigger groups in\u00A0summer (camping and\u00A0working outside in\u00A0provided outdoor facilities).",

    "campBody": "The\u00A0camp will take place between 30.07.21 and\u00A06.08.21.\nWe\u00A0are\u00A0committed to\u00A0creating a\u00A0safer space for\u00A0everyone. So\u00A0we\u00A0invite people of\u00A0all\u00A0gender identities, psychosexual orientations, skin colors, origins, ages and\u00A0economic statuses.\nThe camp itself, as\u00A0well as\u00A0the\u00A0Kopacze-Diggers project, is\u00A0to\u00A0be\u00A0a\u00A0trans*-friendly place, sex(work)positive, vegan, anti-racist, queer and\u00A0feminist (and\u00A0we\u00A0would like to\u00A0emphasize strongly that for\u00A0us\u00A0feminism is\u00A0inextricably linked with the\u00A0rights of\u00A0trans people).\nOur goal is\u00A0for\u00A0the\u00A0community that will form during the\u00A0camp to\u00A0co-organize it\u00A0in\u00A0the\u00A0most non-hierarchical way\u00A0possible.\nWe\u00A0want to\u00A0be\u00A0able to\u00A0share knowledge and\u00A0skills without any\u00A0obstacles during the\u00A0camp, but\u00A0also to\u00A0rest in\u00A0nature and\u00A0escape the\u00A0overwhelming reality of\u00A0oppression (we\u00A0assume the\u00A0possibility of\u00A0creating spaces in\u00A0the\u00A0camp available only for\u00A0specific groups). We\u00A0hope that the\u00A0program will include workshops and\u00A0talks, but\u00A0also free time spent together. We\u00A0are\u00A0also focused on\u00A0strengthening practical skills (building, gardening, working with the\u00A0body). The\u00A0camp will partially be\u00A0an\u00A0alcohol-free space.\nCamp participants will sleep in\u00A0their own\u00A0tents, all\u00A0infrastructure is\u00A0in\u00A0the open air\u00A0(field showers, compost toilets, kitchen, dining room and\u00A0workshop spaces). We\u00A0have the\u00A0capacity to\u00A0accommodate up\u00A0to\u00A035 people. We\u00A0invite people with children, but\u00A0we cannot provide organized care for\u00A0them - however, we\u00A0hope that people coming with children will organize some form of\u00A0care for\u00A0them. Unfortunately, the\u00A0camp area is\u00A0not\u00A0friendly to\u00A0people with mobility difficulties: please contact us\u00A0so\u00A0that we\u00A0can\u00A0tell you\u00A0about the\u00A0obstacles and\u00A0possibilities of\u00A0our\u00A0space. If you are\u00A0taking care of\u00A0an\u00A0animal, we\u00A0recommend that you\u00A0do not\u00A0take it\u00A0with you\u00A0to the\u00A0camp if\u00A0you\u00A0can. Our\u00A0experience shows that a\u00A0lot is\u00A0going on\u00A0during the\u00A0camp and\u00A0it\u00A0is\u00A0difficult to\u00A0combine full participation with taking care of\u00A0an\u00A0animal, which is\u00A0additionally exposed to\u00A0a\u00A0lot of\u00A0stimuli. The\u00A0working languages of\u00A0the\u00A0camp will be\u00A0Polish and\u00A0English, and\u00A0if necessary, we\u00A0will try\u00A0to organize a\u00A0group of\u00A0translators into Russian.\nApplications are\u00A0accepted until June\u00A030,\u00A02021.\nContribution for\u00A0camp costs (including food) is\u00A0300PLN per\u00A0person from 15\u00A0years of\u00A0age, people under 14\u00A0years of\u00A0age - 100PLN. We\u00A0will need a\u00A0non-returnable advance of\u00A0100PLN/person. If\u00A0you\u00A0have the\u00A0means to\u00A0pay\u00A0more and\u00A0thus support the\u00A0project and\u00A0other participants - great! We encourage you\u00A0to donate more. If\u00A0you\u00A0want to\u00A0participate in\u00A0the\u00A0camp but\u00A0the\u00A0suggested fee\u00A0is too\u00A0high, contact us.\nIf you\u00A0agree with our\u00A0values and\u00A0want to\u00A0co-create this camp, fill in\u00A0the\u00A0application form! We\u00A0will send you\u00A0detailed information about the\u00A0space, logistics and\u00A0other practical things that you\u00A0should know before coming to\u00A0the\u00A0camp.",
