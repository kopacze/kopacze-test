For the\u00A0 past years we have been working on\u00A0the\u00A0 garden, making lots of\u00A0 preserves and\u00A0generally familiarising ourselves with our surroundings. We have been renovating the\u00A0 space as\u00A0well and\u00A0a\u00A0number groups have met in\u00A0Kopacze. in\u00A02018 we have organized a\u00A0queer-feminist camp. Second edition of the camp wil take place this summer! Scroll down for more information.",
    
    "campHeader": "Queer-Feminist Camp 2021",
    "campBody": "The\u00A0camp will take place between 30.07.21 and\u00A06.08.21.\n We are\u00A0committed to\u00A0creating a safer space for\u00A0everyone. So we invite people of all gender identities, psychosexual orientations, skin colors, origins, ages and\u00A0economic statuses.\nThe camp itself, as well as the Kopacze-Diggers project, is to be a trans*-friendly place, sex(work)positive, vegan, anti-racist, queer and\u00A0feminist (and we would like to emphasize strongly that for\u00A0us feminism is inextricably linked with the\u00A0rights of trans people).\nOur goal is for the\u00A0community that will form during the\u00A0camp to co-organize it in the most non-hierarchical way\u00A0possible.\nWe want to be able to share knowledge and\u00A0skills without any\u00A0obstacles during the\u00A0camp, but\u00A0also to rest in nature and\u00A0escape the\u00A0overwhelming reality of oppression (we\u00A0assume the\u00A0possibility of creating spaces in the camp available only for\u00A0specific groups). We hope that the\u00A0program will include workshops and\u00A0talks, but\u00A0also free time spent together. We are also focused on strengthening practical skills (building, gardening, working with the\u00A0body). The\u00A0camp will partially be an alcohol-free space.\nCamp participants will sleep in their own\u00A0tents, all\u00A0infrastructure is in the open air\u00A0(field showers, compost toilets, kitchen, dining room and\u00A0workshop spaces). We have the\u00A0capacity to accommodate up to 35 people. We invite people with children, but\u00A0we cannot provide organized care for\u00A0them - however, we hope that people coming with children will organize some form of care for\u00A0them. Unfortunately, the\u00A0camp area is not friendly to people with mobility difficulties: please contact us so that we can tell you\u00A0about the\u00A0obstacles and\u00A0possibilities of our space. If you are\u00A0taking care of an animal, we recommend that you\u00A0do not take it with you\u00A0to the camp if you can. Our\u00A0experience shows that a lot is going on during the\u00A0camp and\u00A0it is difficult to combine full participation with taking care of an animal, which is additionally exposed to a lot of stimuli. The\u00A0working languages of the camp will be Polish and\u00A0English, and\u00A0if necessary, we will try\u00A0to organize a group of translators into Russian.nApplications are\u00A0accepted until June 30,\u00A02021.\nContribution for\u00A0camp costs (including food) is 300PLN per\u00A0person from 15 years of age, people under 14 years of age - 100 PLN. We will need a non-returnable advance of 100PLN/person. If you have the\u00A0means to pay more and\u00A0thus support the\u00A0project and\u00A0other participants - great! We encourage you\u00A0to donate more. If you want to participate in the camp but\u00A0the\u00A0suggested fee\u00A0is too high, contact us.\nIf you\u00A0agree with our\u00A0values and\u00A0want to co-create this camp, fill in the application form! We will send you\u00A0detailed information about the\u00A0space, logistics and\u00A0other practical things that you\u00A0should know before coming to the camp.",
