For the\u00A0 past years we have been working on\u00A0the\u00A0 garden, making lots of\u00A0 preserves and\u00A0generally familiarising ourselves with our surroundings. We have been renovating the\u00A0 space as\u00A0well and\u00A0a\u00A0number groups have met in\u00A0Kopacze. in\u00A02018 we have organized a\u00A0queer-feminist camp. Second edition of the camp wil take place this summer! Scroll down for more information.",

    "campBody": "The camp will take place between 30.07.21 and 6.08.21.\nWe are committed to creating a\u00A0safer space for everyone. So\u00A0we\u00A0invite people of\u00A0all gender identities, psychosexual orientations, skin colors, origins, ages and economic statuses.\nThe camp itself, as\u00A0well as\u00A0the Kopacze-Diggers project, is\u00A0to\u00A0be\u00A0a\u00A0trans*-friendly place, sex(work)positive, vegan, anti-racist, queer and feminist (and we\u00A0would like to\u00A0emphasize strongly that for us\u00A0feminism is\u00A0inextricably linked with the rights of\u00A0trans people).\nOur goal is\u00A0for the community that will form during the camp to\u00A0co-organize it\u00A0in\u00A0the most non-hierarchical way possible.\nWe want to\u00A0be\u00A0able to\u00A0share knowledge and skills without any obstacles during the camp, but also to\u00A0rest in\u00A0nature and escape the overwhelming reality of\u00A0oppression (we assume the possibility of\u00A0creating spaces in\u00A0the camp available only for specific groups). We\u00A0hope that the program will include workshops and talks, but also free time spent together. We\u00A0are also focused on\u00A0strengthening practical skills (building, gardening, working with the body). The camp will partially be\u00A0an\u00A0alcohol-free space.\nCamp participants will sleep in\u00A0their own tents, all infrastructure is\u00A0in\u00A0the open air (field showers, compost toilets, kitchen, dining room and workshop spaces). We\u00A0have the capacity to\u00A0accommodate up\u00A0to\u00A035\u00A0people. We\u00A0invite people with children, but we\u00A0cannot provide organized care for them -\u00A0however, we\u00A0hope that people coming with children will organize some form of\u00A0care for them. Unfortunately, the camp area is\u00A0not friendly to\u00A0people with mobility difficulties: please contact us\u00A0so\u00A0that we\u00A0can tell you about the obstacles and possibilities of\u00A0our space. If\u00A0you are taking care of\u00A0an\u00A0animal, we\u00A0recommend that you do\u00A0not take it\u00A0with you to\u00A0the camp if\u00A0you can. Our experience shows that a\u00A0lot is\u00A0going on\u00A0during the camp and it\u00A0is\u00A0difficult to\u00A0combine full participation with taking care of\u00A0an\u00A0animal, which is\u00A0additionally exposed to\u00A0a\u00A0lot of\u00A0stimuli. The working languages of\u00A0the camp will be\u00A0Polish and English, and if\u00A0necessary, we\u00A0will try to\u00A0organize a\u00A0group of\u00A0translators into Russian.\nApplications are accepted until June 30, 2021.\nContribution for camp costs (including food) is\u00A0300PLN per person from 15\u00A0years of\u00A0age, people under 14\u00A0years of\u00A0age -\u00A0100 PLN. We\u00A0will need a\u00A0non-returnable advance of\u00A0100PLN/person. If\u00A0you have the means to\u00A0pay more and thus support the project and other participants -\u00A0great! We\u00A0encourage you to\u00A0donate more. If\u00A0you want to\u00A0participate in\u00A0the camp but the suggested fee is\u00A0too high, contact us.\nIf you agree with our values and want to\u00A0co-create this camp, fill in\u00A0the application form! We\u00A0will send you detailed information about the space, logistics and other practical things that you should know before coming to\u00A0the camp.",
