For the\u00A0 past years we have been working on\u00A0the\u00A0 garden, making lots of\u00A0 preserves and\u00A0generally familiarising ourselves with our surroundings. We have been renovating the\u00A0 space as\u00A0well and\u00A0a\u00A0number groups have met in\u00A0Kopacze. in\u00A02018 we have organized a\u00A0queer-feminist camp. Second edition of the camp wil take place this summer! Scroll down for more information.",
    
    "campHeader": "Queer-Feminist Camp 2021",
    "campBody": "The\u00A0 camp will take place between 30.07.21 and\u00A0 6.08.21.\nWe are\u00A0 committed to\u00A0 creating a\u00A0 safer space for\u00A0 everyone. So we invite people of all gender identities, psychosexual orientations, skin colors, origins, ages and\u00A0 economic statuses.\nThe camp itself, as well as the Kopacze-Diggers project, is to be a trans*-friendly place, sex(work)positive, vegan, anti-racist, queer and\u00A0 feminist (and we would like to emphasize strongly that for\u00A0 us feminism is inextricably linked with the\u00A0 rights of trans people).\nOur goal is for the\u00A0 community that will form during the\u00A0 camp to co-organize it in the most non-hierarchical way\u00A0 possible.\nWe want to be able to share knowledge and\u00A0 skills without any\u00A0 obstacles during the\u00A0 camp, but\u00A0 also to rest in nature and\u00A0 escape the\u00A0 overwhelming reality of oppression (we\u00A0 assume the\u00A0 possibility of creating spaces in the camp available only for\u00A0 specific groups). We hope that the\u00A0 program will include workshops and\u00A0 talks, but\u00A0 also free time spent together. We are also focused on strengthening practical skills (building, gardening, working with the\u00A0 body). The\u00A0 camp will partially be an alcohol-free space.\nCamp participants will sleep in their own\u00A0 tents, all\u00A0 infrastructure is in the open air\u00A0 (field showers, compost toilets, kitchen, dining room and\u00A0 workshop spaces). We have the\u00A0 capacity to accommodate up to 35 people. We invite people with children, but\u00A0 we cannot provide organized care for\u00A0 them - however, we hope that people coming with children will organize some form of care for\u00A0 them. Unfortunately, the\u00A0 camp area is not friendly to people with mobility difficulties: please contact us so that we can tell you\u00A0 about the\u00A0 obstacles and\u00A0 possibilities of our space. If you are\u00A0 taking care of an animal, we recommend that you\u00A0 do not take it with you\u00A0 to the camp if you can. Our\u00A0 experience shows that a lot is going on during the\u00A0 camp and\u00A0 it is difficult to combine full participation with taking care of an animal, which is additionally exposed to a lot of stimuli. The\u00A0 working languages of the camp will be Polish and\u00A0 English, and\u00A0 if necessary, we will try\u00A0 to organize a group of translators into Russian.\nApplications are\u00A0 accepted until June 30,\u00A0 2021.\nContribution for\u00A0 camp costs (including food) is 300PLN per\u00A0 person from 15 years of age, people under 14 years of age - 100 PLN. We will need a non-returnable advance of 100PLN/person. If you have the\u00A0 means to pay more and\u00A0 thus support the\u00A0 project and\u00A0 other participants - great! We encourage you\u00A0 to donate more. If you want to participate in the camp but\u00A0 the\u00A0 suggested fee\u00A0 is too high, contact us.\nIf you\u00A0 agree with our\u00A0 values and\u00A0 want to co-create this camp, fill in the application form! We will send you\u00A0 detailed information about the\u00A0 space, logistics and\u00A0 other practical things that you\u00A0 should know before coming to the camp.",
